Allwinner SuperSpeed DWC3 USB SoC controller

Required properties:
- compatible:	should contain "allwinner,sun50i-h6-dwc3" for H6 SoC
- clocks:	A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs for the
		clocks listed in clock-names
- clock-names:	Should contain the following:
  "bus"		The bus clock of the DWC3 part
- resets:	A list of phandle + reset-specifier pairs for the
		resets listed in reset-names
- reset-names:	Should contain the following:
  "bus"		The bus reset of the DWC3 part

Required child node:
A child node must exist to represent the core DWC3 IP block. The name of
the node is not important. The content of the node is defined in dwc3.txt.

Phy documentation is provided in the following places:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/sun50i-usb3-phy.txt

Example device nodes:
	usb3: usb@5200000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun50i-h6-dwc3";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;
		clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_XHCI>;
		clock-names = "bus";
		resets = <&ccu RST_BUS_XHCI>;
		reset-names = "bus";

		dwc3: dwc3 {
			compatible = "snps,dwc3";
			reg = <0x5200000 0x10000>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 26 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			phys = <&usb3phy>;
			phy-names = "usb3-phy";
		};
	};
