Date:		Oct 2017
KernelVersion:	4.14

What:		/sys/devices/platform/bootsplash.0/load_file
Date:		Oct 2017
KernelVersion:	4.14
Contact:	Max Staudt <mstaudt@suse.de>
Description:
		Can only be set.

		Any value written will cause the splash to be disabled and
		internal memory structures to be freed.

		A firmware path written will cause a new theme file to be
		loaded and the current bootsplash to be replaced.
		The current enabled/disabled status is not touched.
		If the splash is already active, it will be redrawn.

		The path has to be a path in /lib/firmware since
		request_firmware() is used to fetch the data.

		When setting the splash from the shell, echo -n has to be
		used as any trailing '\n' newline will be interpreted as
		part of the path.
